# CMAS open-code

Hello and welcome to the CMAS open-code project! :tada:

Our goal is to create an online platform where everyone interested in motion analysis can share coding resources.


**Why?** Using motion analysis code can save time and reduce errors by automating routine tasks, and it produce new insights by enabling complex calculations. 

However, not everyone has the skills or time to learn how to develop their own code.

This project is the answer! We will use it to share code, and include step-by-step tutorials on how to develop and use it. 

**People with technical skills** will be able to collaborate, create new tools, and easily share them among all motion analysis labs. 

**Coding beginners** who are keen to develop their skills will find a library of tutorials and example code to support their learning. 

**People who would like to use code** but do not have time or interest in developing it themselves, will be able to easily find relevant resources, with instructions and examples of use.

## Getting Started

Coming soon :construction:
