# CMAS open-code

Hello and welcome to the CMAS open-code project! :tada:

Our goal is to create an online platform where everyone interested in movement analysis can share coding resources.

**Why?** Using movement analysis code can save time and reduce errors by automating routine tasks, and produce new insights by enabling complex calculations. 

However, not everyone has the skills or time to learn how to develop their own code.

:sparkles: This project is the answer! :sparkles: We will use it to share code, and include step-by-step tutorials on how to develop and use it. 

---

**People with technical skills** will be able to collaborate, create new tools, and easily share them among all movement analysis labs. 

**Coding beginners** who are keen to develop their skills will find a library of tutorials and example code to support their learning. 

**People who would like to use code** but do not have time or interest in developing it themselves, will be able to easily find relevant resources, with instructions and examples of use.

## What is movement analysis?

Clinical movement analysis involves the measurement of human movement, typically walking, to help understand pathologies that affect movement.

For example, after a stroke, the damage to the brain can cause an arm or leg to become weak or paralysed, making movement difficult. Another example is amputation, which requires a patient to be fitted with a prosthetic leg. 

Clinical movement analysis provides information to the clinicians about the damage caused by the stroke, or the performance of the prosthetic leg.   

The equipment used in movement analysis include 2D video, 3D computerised motion capture, force and muscle activity measurements. 

You can read more about movement analysis [here](https://cmasuki.org/introduction-to-movement-analysis/).
