**Do you code, but not for motion analysis?** 
You could contribute coding tutorials and resources for writing good code. 

**Do you work in motion analysis but do not code (yet)?** 
You could review existing material, and improve motion analysis documentation. 

**Do you work with audio/video?** 
You could convert training material to video tutorials.

**All contributors:** 
Please report bugs, request resources, and review proposed changes. Thank you for helping us expand and improve! :smiley::tada::sparkles:

We use [Github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to keep track of the work we are doing, or we think we need to do in the future. We [label](https://github.com/cmasuki/open-code/labels) inssues according to their type, and this can help you identify how you can contribute.

If you are new to GitHub, see the [Contributor Guidelines](#contributor-guidelines) section below.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we can, acknowledge your contributions and help you become a member of our community.
Everyone involved in CMAS open-code agrees to abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributor Guidelines

Before you start you'll need to set up a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and sign in. Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

Have a look around the project! Make sure you read the [README file](https://github.com/cmasuki/open-code/blob/master/README.md) and the [list of current issues](https://github.com/cmasuki/open-code/issues). 

Once you've identified a way to contribute, you're ready to make a change to the project repository! :tada:

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a comment to the issue you've identified, or make a new issue.

    The purpose of writing a good comment in advance is to ensure you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.
    
    [This blog](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.
    
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [CMAS open-code repository](https://github.com/cmasuki/open-code) to your profile.

    You can now do whatever you want with this copy of the project. You won't mess up anyone else's work so you're safe.

3. Make the changes you've discussed. How you do this depends on the nature of the changes.
    
    * Are you simply fixing typing mistakes? Go ahead and make your corrections on your forked repository (the "master branch").
    * Are you changing more than typing mistakes, but they are all changes you can make on Github itself? Then please create a [separate branch](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository). This isolates your work so it doesn't affect your master branch. If you wanted, you could be working on multiple branches at once, addressing different issues! Thank you for your enthusiasm :thumbsup: You can read more about branches [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-branches). 
    * Do you need to do work on your local machine, for example run and test the code you are contributing? Then you'll need to [set up Git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git) and create a local clone of your forked repository. Make changes to your local clone, and when you are ready, [push](https://help.github.com/en/articles/pushing-to-a-remote) your changes to the forked repository. Read more about [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
    
4. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests).
    
    A member of the main team will review your changes, have a bit of discussion and hopefully merge them in!

**Success!!** :balloon::balloon::balloon: Well done! And thank you :smiley:
