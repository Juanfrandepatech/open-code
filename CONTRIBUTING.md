# Contributing

CMAS open-code is an open source project, and we welcome your contribution, whether you work in motion analysis or not!

- If you are an experienced coder in motion analysis, you could contribute code and documentation for motion analysis applications
- If you code, but not for motion analysis, you could contribute coding tutorials and resources for writing good code
- If you work in motion analysis but do not code (yet!), you could review existing material, and improve motion analysis documentation
- If you work with audio/video, you could convert training material to video tutorials
- Everyone: report bugs, request resources, review proposed changes
